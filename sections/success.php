                                <p>Over a period of six years, Jason successfully created more than $200 million of value through the development process. He raised equity, managed debt and was actively engaged in all daily pre-development aspects for three south Florida luxury condominiums, one of which included a retail component. Together the projects encompassed 850,000 SF and almost 400 units with a sellout value of $738 million. This success was achieved by laying a good early foundation – undertaking a thorough financial analysis, appropriately structuring both debt and equity for each of the properties, closing financing in each instance and applying both project level and asset management skills.</p>

                                <p>Recognizing the long-term needs of New York City, Jason was involved with the acquisition of several sites along the Gowanus Canal as the industrial neighborhood was undergoing a significant 82-block mixed-use rezoning. Ultimately 8,200 new housing units are projected within 15 years with a significant number reserved as permanently affordable.</p>
                                <p>To uncover value, he worked inside this rezoning framework leveraging a deep understanding of public/private partnerships and government processes to acquire the sites and shepherd them the through New York City’s extensive Uniform Land Use Review Procedure (ULURP). This public review process is not for the faint of heart, particularly when the land in question has the potential for 1M GSF and more than 700 units of housing along with supporting retail uses. His efforts, which included monitoring the site remediation, resulted in significant value add at disposition.</p>

                                <p>Over the course of almost a decade Jason was deeply engaged in the complex assemblage of one of New York’s most opulent properties. The resulting structure, artfully transforms the existing structure into the “old New York” residences and blends it in to a new glass 1,400 foot tall residential tower that reaches into the sky. The project, which reshaped the Central Park skyline, includes 60 ultra-luxury condominiums atop a five-story retail podium.</p>
                                <p>This was a complex project to design, build and capitalize. It sat on a small lot where it became one of the slimmest towers in the world. Its $ 1billion complex capital structure included a variety of institutions providing a mixture of both equity and debt. The estimated $1.7 billion sellout will ultimately create a net profit of over $700 million, much of which was predicated on the economic analysis and valuation Jason provided early on to the joint venture.</p>

                                <p>From the early stages of development through to refinancing and, ultimately, disposition, Jason created value for this $220 million project in a burgeoning Queens neighborhood. Intimately involved in all facets of development from the initial equity raise to managing the capital stack and closing the construction loan, he also supervised design and entitlements, marketing and lease up. With a decision to self-perform construction, Jason built an in-house team and performed on-site supervision, including responsibility for all subcontractors involved in erecting the 391 luxury rentals with complementary retail space. Overcoming financial challenges throughout the process, he ultimately led the project to stabilization and a disposition valued at over $300 million.</p>

With just 16 days to complete the transaction, Jason structured a unique deal to purchase air rights, create a combined developable site and conceive a public park to meet a community benefit requirement. The 837,000 buildable SF site could be zoned for up to 800 residential units – among the tallest buildings in the neighborhood. The quick work on the $170 million project resulted in a sale to a major NYC developer and a win/win/win for seller, buyer and community alike.</p>

                            As a participant, our team members had worked alongside the local municipality as a partner, allowing us to have an active voice in the the step-by-step creation of this new rezoning framework.
